# TableauWorkbookDocumentationScript

With the help of my trusty AI friend ChatGPT and a lot of time, I was able to whip up this script that documents all of the calculated fields and parameters in a Tableau workbook and outputs them in an Excel file.

It additionally creates a flowcart that visualizes the relationships between all of the calculated fields in the workbook.

I use jupyter labs / Anaconda to run this script.

My next plans for this script are to figure out how to use the Tableau rest API (I discovered it recently), and to figure out how to get it to document the data sources and their joins.
